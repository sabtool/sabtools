    indianContextTemplate: "India's measurement landscape is uniquely complex because traditional, metric, and imperial systems coexist in daily life. Government land records often use hectares, property dealers quote in square feet or bigha, and farmers think in acres or local units. The jewellery industry still operates in tolas and rattis alongside grams. Cooking recipes from different regions use katoris, glasses, and pav as informal volume measures. {name} was built with this multilayered reality in mind. Unlike converter tools designed for Western users that only cover metric and imperial, SabTools converters include regional Indian units with their state-specific variations. With India's rapidly growing international trade, e-commerce, and diaspora community, the need for quick and accurate conversions has never been greater. Freelancers working with international clients need to convert currencies and measurements daily. Students following global educational content on platforms like Khan Academy need unit conversions for science problems stated in unfamiliar systems. {name} serves all of these needs from a single, free, browser-based interface accessible to anyone in India.",

Where regional variations exist, such as different bigha sizes across Indian states, the tool specifies which definition is being used so your conversion is accurate for your particular context." },
      { q: "How accurate are the conversion results from {name}?", a: "The conversion factors used in {name} are sourced from international metrology standards and verified against authoritative Indian references. For standard unit conversions like metres to feet or kilograms to pounds, the results are mathematically exact. For units with regional variations like bigha, the tool uses the most commonly accepted definition and clearly states which one." },
      { q: "Can I convert between multiple units at once?", a: "The primary interface converts between two selected units, but many conversion tools on SabTools also display a reference table showing your input value converted into all related units simultaneously. This is particularly useful when you need to compare across three or four different measurement systems at the same time." },
      { q: "Does {name} work without an internet connection?", a: "Yes. All conversion factors are embedded directly in the page code — there are no server lookups or API calls for the actual conversion calculation. Once the page loads in your browser, you can disconnect from the internet and continue converting values. This makes {name} reliable in areas with spotty connectivity." },
      { q: "Is {name} useful for school and college students?", a: "Very much so. Students encounter unit conversions constantly in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. {name} not only gives the converted value but also shows the conversion factor and formula, helping students understand the relationship between units. Many teachers recommend it as a reference tool for solving numericals that require intermediate unit conversions." },
      { q: "Why do some Indian units have different values in different states?", a: "Indian traditional measurement units evolved regionally before standardization, so a bigha in Rajasthan, UP, Bihar, and West Bengal can all represent different areas. Similarly, a guntha in Maharashtra differs from a guntha in Karnataka. {name} notes these variations and lets you select the specific regional definition when it matters for an accurate conversion." },
      { q: "Can jewellers use {name} for gold weight conversions?", a: "Absolutely. Indian jewellers frequently need to convert between tola, gram, ounce troy, and ratti. {name} supports all these gold and precious metal weight units with high precision. Many jewellers in smaller towns keep the tool open on their shop phone to quickly convert weights when customers ask for pricing in different units." },

The Indian workforce increasingly operates across timezones, with the IT services industry alone employing millions who coordinate daily with teams in the US, Europe, and the Middle East. Government job applications in India have notoriously strict age eligibility rules — UPSC, SSC, banking recruitment, and state services all specify cutoff dates where being even one day over the limit means disqualification. {name} prevents costly miscalculations in these high-stakes situations. The Indian calendar is also uniquely complex — with national holidays, state-specific holidays, restricted holidays, and festival dates that follow the lunar calendar and change every year. Business day calculations must account for this variability.

In all these contexts, {name} provides the precision that Indian users need for official, professional, and financial date and time computations.",
    faqTemplates: [
      { q: "Does {name} use Indian Standard Time by default?", a: "{name} detects your device's timezone setting automatically, and since most Indian users have their devices set to IST (UTC+5:30), it defaults to Indian Standard Time. For timezone conversion tools, IST is prominently featured. You can manually select any timezone if needed. India does not observe daylight saving time, so the IST offset remains constant throughout the year." },
      { q: "Can I calculate my exact age for a government job application?", a: "Yes, this is one of the most common uses. Enter your date of birth and the eligibility cutoff date specified in the job notification. {name} calculates your age in years, months, and days — the exact format that UPSC, SSC, banking, and railway recruitment boards require. Always use the cutoff date mentioned in the official notification, not the application date." },
      { q: "Does {name} account for leap years correctly?", a: "Yes. The calculation engine correctly handles all leap year rules including the century exception — years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless also divisible by 400. This means February 29 exists in 2024 and 2028 but not in 1900, and all day counts spanning these dates are computed accurately." },
      { q: "Can I calculate business days excluding Indian holidays?", a: "The tool can exclude weekends from day counts, and where supported, common Indian national holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day, and Gandhi Jayanti. However, since India has state-specific holidays that vary by region, the tool may not cover every local holiday. For precise business day counts in legal or contractual contexts, verify the holiday list applicable to your specific state and adjust accordingly." },
      { q: "How does {name} handle timezone conversions?", a: "The tool uses the standard IANA timezone database which includes all global timezones with their UTC offsets and daylight saving time rules. When converting between IST and a timezone that observes DST — like US Eastern or UK time — the tool adjusts the offset based on the specific date of conversion, not just a fixed offset. This prevents the common error of using summer offsets during winter or vice versa." },
      { q: "Is {name} useful for financial calculations like FD tenure?", a: "Very useful. Banks calculate interest based on exact days between deposit and maturity dates. Even a one-day difference in tenure can slightly affect the maturity amount on large deposits. {name} gives you the exact day count, which you can then use in interest calculations. This is especially valuable when comparing FD offers from different banks with different tenure options." },
      { q: "Can I use {name} for historical dates?", a: "Yes. The tool can calculate differences between dates going back centuries, which is useful for historical research, genealogy, and verifying dates in legal documents.

This makes it suitable for use on office shared workstations, cybercafe computers, or library terminals." },
      { q: "Why does {name} run in the browser instead of on a server?", a: "For security tools, client-side processing is not just a preference — it is a security requirement. If a password generator or hash tool sent your data to a server, that creates a transmission vulnerability, a storage vulnerability, and a trust requirement. By running entirely in your browser, {name} eliminates all three risks. Your sensitive data exists only in your browser's memory for the duration of your session." },

    indianContextTemplate: "WhatsApp dominates the Indian communication landscape in a way no other platform does in any country. Over five hundred million Indians use WhatsApp daily, and it has become the default channel for business communication in every sector — from street vendors sharing product photos to enterprise sales teams closing deals. The Indian government communicates important notices through WhatsApp, schools share homework through class groups, and healthcare providers send appointment reminders through the platform. For India's vast small business ecosystem — estimated at over sixty million micro, small, and medium enterprises — WhatsApp is often the only customer communication tool. Yet the app itself lacks built-in features for link generation, advanced formatting, and business utilities that these users need. {name} fills this gap by providing free, easy-to-use WhatsApp enhancement tools that require no technical knowledge and no account access. As WhatsApp continues to expand into payments, shopping, and business services in India, the need for complementary utility tools grows alongside it.",

The Indian Council of Medical Research reports that over seventy-seven million Indians have diabetes, making it the diabetes capital of the world. South Asian body composition means health risks begin at lower BMI and waist circumference thresholds compared to Western populations. Despite this, health awareness remains inconsistent — a large proportion of Indians do not know their basic health numbers like BMI, blood sugar levels, or daily caloric needs. {name} helps bridge this awareness gap by making health calculations free, private, and accessible on any smartphone. With India's doctor-to-patient ratio remaining challenging outside major cities, tools that enable basic health self-monitoring are genuinely valuable. They do not replace doctors but they do ensure that when someone visits a healthcare provider, the conversation starts from a more informed place.

For any health concerns, symptoms, or treatment decisions, always consult a qualified healthcare professional." },
      { q: "Does {name} use Indian health standards?", a: "Where available, yes. For example, BMI interpretation uses Asian/South Asian cutoffs recommended by WHO for Asian populations and referenced by ICMR — which place the overweight threshold at 23 rather than 25. Caloric recommendations consider common Indian dietary patterns. Where specific Indian standards are not established for a metric, the tool uses WHO global guidelines." },
      { q: "Is my health data kept private?", a: "Completely. All calculations happen in your browser using JavaScript — your height, weight, age, and any other health inputs are never transmitted to any server, stored in any database, or shared with any third party. Close the browser tab and the data ceases to exist. No login means no health profile is ever created or linked to your identity." },
      { q: "Can I use {name} to track my fitness progress over time?", a: "Yes. While the tool does not store historical data, you can note down or screenshot your results periodically and compare them. Many users calculate their metrics on the first of every month to track fitness progress. Consider maintaining a simple spreadsheet or diary with your monthly readings from {name} for a clear progress view." },

These are the same formulas that healthcare professionals use in clinical settings for screening and health assessment. The accuracy of your result depends on the accuracy of the measurements you enter." },
      { q: "Should I be worried if my BMI is slightly above normal?", a: "A BMI slightly above the normal range indicates you may be carrying more weight than optimal for your height. For South Asian populations, even small BMI increases above twenty-three are associated with higher diabetes and cardiovascular risk. It is not a cause for panic but it is a signal worth discussing with your doctor, especially if you have a family history of lifestyle diseases." },
      { q: "Can pregnant women use {name}?", a: "Pregnancy-specific health tools on SabTools are designed for general awareness and milestone tracking. However, every pregnancy is unique and individual health conditions vary. Always follow your obstetrician's specific advice over any general calculator output. The tools can help you understand common milestones and expected ranges, which makes your doctor consultations more informed." },

    indianContextTemplate: "India's income tax system affects over eight crore individual taxpayers and is one of the most complex in the world due to its dual-regime structure, numerous deduction sections, and frequent annual modifications through the Union Budget. The introduction of the new tax regime created a genuine dilemma for taxpayers — the lower slab rates look attractive on paper, but giving up deductions under Sections 80C, 80D, HRA, and home loan interest can make the old regime cheaper for many individuals. This complexity creates a massive demand for accurate, accessible tax calculation tools. Most Indians cannot afford to consult a chartered accountant for every what-if tax scenario, and the Income Tax Department's own online tools, while improving, are not designed for the kind of quick comparative analysis that taxpayers need during financial planning. {name} fills this gap by providing free, instant, and accurate tax computation based on the latest rules.

If you have significant deductions through Section 80C, 80D, HRA, and home loan interest, the old regime often results in lower tax. If your deductions are minimal, the new regime's lower slab rates may be better.

However, CAs provide value beyond arithmetic — they advise on tax planning strategies, handle complex situations like capital gains and international income, represent you in case of scrutiny, and file your return correctly. Think of {name} as your first step and your CA as the expert who reviews and finalizes." },
      { q: "Does {name} calculate advance tax liability?", a: "If the tool shows a final tax payable amount, you can use that figure to estimate your advance tax obligations. Indian advance tax rules require payment of fifteen percent by June 15, forty-five percent by September 15, seventy-five percent by December 15, and hundred percent by March 15. Divide your estimated annual liability according to these percentages for each quarter." },

For historical tax computation, refer to the slab rates applicable in that specific year." },
      { q: "What is the difference between tax payable and TDS deducted?", a: "Tax payable is your total income tax liability for the year. TDS is the tax your employer or income source has already deducted before paying you. If TDS exceeds your liability, you get a refund when filing your ITR. If TDS is less than your liability, you need to pay the balance. Use {name} to check whether your TDS is tracking correctly against your actual obligation." }

Whether you are crafting gradients, shadows, border effects, animations, or layout utilities, this tool provides a visual interface that shows you exactly what your CSS will look like before you copy it into your stylesheet. {description}. For Indian web developers — from freshers just learning CSS at coding bootcamps to senior engineers at product companies — the tool eliminates the trial-and-error cycle that eats into productive development time. Instead of writing a shadow value, saving, refreshing, adjusting, saving again — you drag a slider and see the result instantly. The generated CSS is clean, standards-compliant, and cross-browser compatible. Copy the code with one click and paste it directly into your project. No frameworks, no dependencies, no build step — just pure CSS that works everywhere.",
    whatIsTemplate: "{name} is a visual CSS property generator that lets you configure specific CSS effects through an interactive interface and outputs production-ready CSS code. The tool renders a live preview of the CSS property you are configuring, using actual browser rendering through HTML5 Canvas or live DOM manipulation so what you see is exactly what you will get in your project. The generated code follows CSS specifications, uses standard property syntax, and includes vendor prefixes where still needed for broader browser support. For developers who understand CSS conceptually but struggle to remember exact syntax for properties like box-shadow, text-shadow, gradient, transform, or filter, {name} is a visual translator — you describe the visual effect you want by adjusting controls, and the tool translates it into correct CSS syntax. This is particularly valuable for CSS properties with complex multi-value syntax that is easy to get wrong when typing from memory.",
    howToSteps: [
      "Open {name} on SabTools.in — the CSS tool loads with a live preview area and configuration controls ready for immediate interaction",
      "Start with the default settings to see the baseline CSS effect, then adjust individual properties to understand what each parameter controls",

      "Watch the preview area to see exactly how your CSS will render in a real browser, eliminating guesswork about property value combinations",
      "Fine-tune the values until the visual effect matches your design mockup or creative vision — the live feedback loop makes this fast and precise",
      "Review the generated CSS code displayed below the preview — this is the production-ready code you will use in your project",

    indianContextTemplate: "India's web development industry is among the largest globally, with millions of developers working on projects for domestic and international clients. CSS expertise is a core requirement across the industry — from IT services companies like Infosys and TCS that build client websites, to startups creating their own product interfaces, to the vast freelance community on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. Despite its importance, CSS proficiency remains uneven because the language is deceptively complex and most coding education focuses more on JavaScript frameworks than on design implementation. {name} helps bridge this skill gap by making CSS generation visual and intuitive. For the hundreds of thousands of Indian developers who handle both design and code — common in small teams and freelance work — visual CSS tools are especially valuable. Indian tech education is also embracing web development more broadly, with NIIT, Aptech, and numerous online platforms teaching CSS as part of full-stack curricula. {name} serves as a practical companion tool for these learning journeys, letting students experiment with CSS effects and see the code that produces them.",
    faqTemplates: [
      { q: "Does the CSS code from {name} work in all browsers?", a: "Yes. The generated CSS uses standard property syntax compatible with all modern browsers — Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Samsung Internet. Where vendor prefixes are still needed for broader compatibility, the tool includes them automatically. The code works on both desktop and mobile browsers without modification." },
      { q: "Can I use the generated CSS in React, Vue, or Angular projects?", a: "Absolutely. The output is standard CSS that works in any framework or project. For React, paste it into a CSS file, CSS module, or styled-component. For Vue, use it in scoped or global styles. For Angular, add it to component styles. The CSS is framework-agnostic and requires no adaptation." },
      { q: "Is the generated CSS code optimized for performance?", a: "Yes. The code is clean and minimal — it includes only the properties needed for the specific effect without unnecessary redundancy. Properties like box-shadow and gradient are hardware-accelerated in modern browsers, so using them does not cause performance issues. For animations, the tool generates GPU-friendly transforms where applicable." },
      { q: "Can I use {name} to learn CSS?", a: "It is an excellent learning tool. The live preview creates an immediate visual feedback loop — change a value and see the result instantly. This is far more effective for understanding CSS properties than reading documentation alone. Many coding students and bootcamp participants use visual CSS tools as part of their learning process." },
      { q: "Do I need to credit SabTools when using the generated CSS?", a: "No attribution required. The generated CSS code is yours to use in personal, commercial, and client projects without any credit, license, or attribution requirement. The code consists of standard CSS property values, not creative works, so it belongs to you from the moment you copy it." },
      { q: "Can I generate CSS for responsive designs?", a: "The tool generates the CSS property values themselves, which you can then use within your own media queries for responsive behavior. The generated CSS works identically across screen sizes — to make properties responsive, wrap them in media queries in your stylesheet with different values for different breakpoints." },
      { q: "How is {name} different from browser DevTools CSS editing?", a: "Browser DevTools let you edit existing CSS on a live page, which is great for debugging. {name} is different — it provides a purpose-built visual interface for generating new CSS code from scratch. The controls, live preview, and code output are optimized for the creation workflow rather than the inspection and debugging workflow that DevTools serves." },
      { q: "Can designers without coding knowledge use {name}?", a: "Yes. The visual interface with sliders, color pickers, and dropdowns requires no CSS knowledge to operate. You adjust the visual result and the tool generates the code. Designers can create the exact effect they envision and hand the generated CSS code to a developer for integration, significantly reducing design-to-development communication overhead." }

    indianContextTemplate: "India's education system is one of the largest and most examination-intensive in the world. Over thirty million students appear for Class 10 and Class 12 board exams annually across CBSE, ICSE, and state boards. Competitive entrance exams — JEE for engineering, NEET for medicine, CAT for management, UPSC for civil services — shape the career trajectories of millions more. In this high-stakes environment, academic calculations carry real consequences. A half-percent difference in aggregate can determine college admission, a few marks can separate selection from rejection in government job exams, and CGPA-to-percentage conversion affects scholarship eligibility. Yet many students and parents lack access to reliable calculation tools — they depend on informal formulas passed around on WhatsApp or rough estimates that may be inaccurate. {name} provides authoritative academic calculations based on official formulas used by examination boards and universities. The tool is particularly valuable for students in tier-2 and tier-3 cities who lack the institutional support that coaching centres and elite schools provide to their urban counterparts. Education should be the great equalizer, and accurate academic tools should be available to every student regardless of their economic background or geographic location.",

This helps with college preference planning during counseling." },
      { q: "Does {name} work for state board students?", a: "The tool supports CBSE and ICSE grading systems primarily, along with common university GPA formats. State boards use varying grading and percentage systems — if your state board follows a standard percentage-based marking system, the percentage-related calculations will work. For state-board-specific conversions, verify the formula against your board's official documentation." },
      { q: "Can teachers use {name} for result preparation?", a: "Absolutely.
